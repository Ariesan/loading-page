# Loading Page

Day 1 : [Loading Page](https://ariesan.github.io/loading-page/)

Until today, July 13, 2022. I still couldn't grasp how javascript work. So, i made a decision to make it familiar for me, by doing simple thing with Javascript.

Hence this is my attempt to practice coding everyday. Loading page is simple project using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for style and Javascript to do the heavy lifting. 

how this app work? If you reload the page you'll be given blurry image with loading progress from 0% to 100%. And when it reached to 100%, the loading text will disappear and the image will be shown.

Enjoy it, and c u next time.
